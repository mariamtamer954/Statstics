## Introduction üí°

"Sleep Disorders Data Set" about sleep disorders which caused by Various factors as (Physical activity level \_stress level_BMI_blood pressure_Daily steps ) all these factors are mentioned as variables in the data set There are more considerations can affect sleep disorder like age as it is said that as you become older your sleep quality decrease .Gender ,people think that Females Gain sleep quality more than Males . Occupation , there are sayings that people who work in medical Fields can't attain high sleep quality and suffer from sleep disorders in this analysis we want to know which saying is a rumor and which is true . This analysis provides sufficient guide to know which factors affect more on sleep quality that lead to sleep disorders , it provides also visualizations to enhance knowledge through descriptive analysis ,know the relations between variables and the correlation between them through exploratory analysis . this analysis contain type of predictive analysis through regression analysis .

### Objective üí°

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sleep quality and disorders by investigating key variables such as Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Daily Steps, and Sleep Disorder.

-   Examine the impact of Gender and Age on sleep patterns.

-   Analyze the relationship between Stress Levels and Sleep Duration to determine whether higher stress leads to shorter sleep.

-   Assess how Physical Activity Levels and Daily Steps influence sleep quality. Explore whether different Occupations affect sleep patterns and contribute to sleep disorders.

-   Use descriptive and exploratory analysis to uncover trends and correlations between variables.

-   Develop predictive models to identify factors that are most likely to cause sleep disorders and simulate scenarios to test findings.

-   This analysis seeks to deliver data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to improve sleep quality and overall¬†well-being.

     main = "Age Density of Individuals in the data set 'sleep disorders'",
     xlab = "Age",
     col = "blue",
     lwd = 2)
```

The density increasing the age 40 is the highest with density 0.08 then the density is decreasing to age

60

##### 3-what is the distribution of the occupation ?

```{r}
jobrole_counts <- table(data$Occupation)

```

The occupations are the same average of sleep which is 7.14

##### 9-what is the average stress level with different BMI categagory ?

```{r}
# Group by BMI Category and calculate the mean Stress Level
td <- data %>%
  group_by(`BMI Category`) %>%
  summarise(Average_Stress_Level = mean(`Stress Level`, na.rm = TRUE))
# Plotting the data
h <- ggplot(td, aes(x = `BMI Category`, y = Average_Stress_Level, fill = `BMI Category`)) +

The highest stress level is the scientist which is more than 6 while the least stress level is the engineer which is less than 4

##### 12-What is the summary of all variables?

```{r}
summary(data)
```

## Exploratory Analysis üóù

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

# Install GGally if not already installed

library(GGally)

# Exclude the "Person ID" column and select numeric data
numeric_data <- data[, sapply(data, is.numeric)]  # Select numeric columns

  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Prevalence of Sleep Disorders by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Sleep disorder Proportion")


```

-   The proportion of individuals without sleep disorders ("None") appears to dominate in both genders.

-   The proportion of "Insomnia" is slightly higher in females than in males which indicates gender related reason

-   The proportion of "sleep Apnea" is higher in female

##### 2-What are the trends in sleep duration across different age groups?

```{r}

                         labels = c("0-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59", "60-64", "+")))

# Calculate average sleep duration for each age group
age_sleep <- dataset %>%
  group_by(Age.Group) %>%
  summarise(Average_Sleep = mean(data$`Sleep Duration`, na.rm = TRUE))

# Visualize trends in sleep duration across age groups
ggplot(age_sleep, aes(x = Age.Group, y = Average_Sleep)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Average Sleep Duration Across Age Groups", x = "Age Group", y = "Average Sleep Duration")
```

-   This Bar char indicates that average sleep duration is the same across different age groups

-   It indicates that age is not a significant factor to sleep duration

##### 3-what is the correlation between sleep duration and quality of sleep ?

```{r}
# Calculate the correlation
correlation <- cor(data$`Sleep Duration`, data$`Quality of Sleep`, method = "pearson")

  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality",
    x = "Sleep Duration (hours)",
    y = "Sleep Quality (score)"
  ) 
```

-   Sleep duration is observed between 5 and 9 hours, and sleep quality scores range from 4 to 9

-   The red regression line indicates a positive linear relationship between sleep duration and sleep quality. As sleep duration increases, sleep quality also appears to improve.

##### 4-sleep disorder distribution according to stress level ?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x =`Sleep Disorder`, y = `Stress Level`, fill =`Sleep Disorder`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of stress level by sleep disorder",
    x = "Sleep Disorder ",
    y = "Stress Level"
  )
```

-   The median stress level is highest for individuals with Insomnia, and by those with Sleep Apnea. Individuals with no sleep disorder have the lowest median stress level

-   The max value of stress level caused by sleep apnea and isonomia

-   people with none sleep disorder has the lowest max value with stress

##### 5-people with stress according to occupation

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x =Occupation, y = `Stress Level`, fill =Occupation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of stress by occupation ",
    x = "occupation ",
    y = "stress level "
  )
```

-   Through this box plot between occupation and stress level indicates that Engineer has the lowest strees level = 2 , and scientist has the highest stress =8

-   Some occupations, such as Engineer and Nurse , show a larger interquartile range, indicating more variability in stress levels within these groups

##### 6-People sleep quality with their occupation

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x =Occupation, y = `Quality of Sleep`, fill =Occupation)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of sleep quality by occupation ",
    x = "occupation ",
    y = "Quality of sleep"
  ) 
```

-   This box plot between Occupation and quality of sleep indicates that engineer attain highest sleep quality =9 while scientist has lowest sleep quality .

-   Nurse has more interquartile range which means variability in quality of sleep ion this occupation .

##### 7-Scatter plot between quality of sleep and stress level ?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = `Stress Level`, y = `Quality of Sleep`)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality",
    x = "Stress Level ",
    y = "Sleep Quality (score)"
  ) 


```

-   This scatter plot indicates an negative linear relation ship between stress level and sleep quality

-   As stress level increase sleep quality decrease

##### 8-Is there is a relation between daily steps and sleep Duration ?

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = `Daily Steps`, y = `Sleep Duration`)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Daily Steps and Sleep Duration ",
    x = "Daily steps  ",
    y = "Sleep Duration "
  ) 

```

-   The red trend line appears relatively flat, indicating a weak or negligible linear correlation between daily steps and sleep duration.

<!-- -->

-   The slope of the line suggests that an increase in daily steps does not substantially affect sleep duration

-   Most data points are concentrated between 4,000 and 8,000 daily steps and between 6 and 8 hours of sleep duration, indicating these ranges are the most common.

## Predictive Analysis üìà

##### 1-Can daily steps predict sleep duration ?

```{r}
xs <- lm(data$`Sleep Duration`~ data$`Daily Steps`, data = data) 
summary(xs)
```

-   THERE IS a weak negative association between daily steps and sleep duration.

-   Daily steps explain only a very small portion (less than 0.3%) of the variability in sleep duration.

##### 2-Can stress level predict quality of sleep ?

```{r}
xs <- lm(data$`Quality of Sleep`~ data$`Stress Level`, data = data) 
summary(xs)
```

-   There is a strong negative association between quality of sleep and stress level.

-   Quality of sleep is a significant predictor of Stress levels.

-   ùêª0: ùõΩ1 = 0 \[There is no linear relationship (the slope is zero).\]

-   ùêª1: ùõΩ1 ‚â† 0 \[There is a linear relationship (the slope is not zero).\]

-   H1 is accepted

##### 3-Heart rate predict quality of sleep

```{r}
xs <- lm(data$`Quality of Sleep`~ data$`Heart Rate`, data = data) 
summary(xs)
```

-   There are a strong negative association between heart rate and quality of sleep(-0.099599 )

-   The R-squared value 18.57% of the variability in quality of sleep can be explained by heart rate.

-   p-value is less than level of significance 0.05 so H1 is accepted so the model is significance

##### 

## Inferential Analysis üìà

##### 1-Does gender significantly influence sleep quality?

```{r}
# T-test to compare sleep quality by gender
  t_test <- t.test(data$`Quality of Sleep` ~ data$Gender, data = data)
print(t_test)
```

-   There are a significant difference in the quality of sleep between females and males.

-   Females in the study reported significantly better sleep quality than males.

##### 2-Is sleep duration significantly associated with age?

```{r}
age_sleep_corr <- cor.test(data$Age, data$`Sleep Duration`, use = "complete.obs")
print(age_sleep_corr)

#using regression to know exactly by how 
# Linear regression
lm_age <- lm(data$`Sleep Duration` ~ data$Age, data = data)
summary(lm_age)

```

-   The Pearson correlation analysis shows a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.27, there is a weak positive relationship between Age and Sleep Duration.

-   The regression show that Age significantly impacts Sleep Duration, with sleep increasing by 0.0277 hours for each year of age.

-   The relationship is highly significant (p \< 2e-16). However, the model explains only 7.27% of the variation in sleep duration, suggesting other factors are more influential.

##### 3-Does daily steps has an effect on sleep duration ?

```{r}
anova(lm(data$`Sleep Duration`~ data$`Daily Steps`, data = data))
```

-   There are significant relationship between Daily Steps and Sleep Duration

-   (We reject the hypothesis ùêª0)

    ##### 4-Is there a significant relationship between sleep duration and stress levels?

    ```{r}
    cor_test <- cor.test(data$`Sleep Duration`, data$`Stress Level`, use = "complete.obs")
    print(cor_test)
    ```

    -   There are a strong negative relationship between Sleep Duration and Stress Level.

    -   Higher stress levels are associated with shorter sleep durations in the sample.

        ```{r}
        lm_model <-lm(data$`Sleep Duration` ~ data$`Stress Level`, data = data)
        summary(lm_model)
        ```

        -   There are a strong and significant negative relationship between Stress Level and Sleep Duration.

        -   For every unit increase in Stress level, Sleep duration decreases by approximately 0.32 hours.

        -   The p-value (\< 2e-16) indicates the relationship is highly significant

        -   The model explains about 42.46% of the variation in sleep duration (R-squared = 0.4246), suggesting that stress level is a key factor influencing sleep duration

## Simulation üí°

### Conclusion:

\
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders. The results highlight significant relationships between Sleep Duration, Stress Levels, Physical Activity, BMI Category, and Daily Steps, demonstrating how lifestyle and health metrics impact sleep patterns.

Gender and Age influence sleep quality, with variations observed across different demographics. Stress Levels are inversely related to Sleep Duration, suggesting that higher stress leads to shorter and potentially lower-quality sleep. Physical Activity and Daily Steps show a positive correlation with better sleep quality, emphasizing the role of an active lifestyle in promoting healthier sleep. Occupations associated with irregular working hours, such as nurses and doctors, exhibit higher instances of sleep disorders, reflecting the impact of work-life balance on rest. Predictive modeling further strengthens the ability to identify individuals at risk of sleep disorders, offering opportunities for early intervention.

Final Recommendation: Promoting physical activity, managing stress levels, and encouraging healthier lifestyle choices can significantly improve sleep quality. Employers and healthcare providers should also consider workplace adjustments and targeted programs to address sleep-related issues, especially in high-risk professions.

This study serves as a foundation for further research and practical solutions to enhance sleep health and overall¬†well-being.
